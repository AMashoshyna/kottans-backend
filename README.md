Though I was familiar with most of the material it was still very interesting to review it. I especially enjoyed the udacity git course.

Making interactive tutorials was fun, but I knew already most of it's contents. Linuxcommand was actually much more fun. Especially I liked how a guy called Windows "legacy operating system" and "the other operating system" as if it was Lord Voldemort and you can't say its name.\
And I was also familiar with, but again amused by a weird way the bash shell defines function: with brackets just as a useless sintax marker and passing arguments as command line arguments. I am shure, there's a very good reason to make it like this, but it turnes reading function arguments into a tricky business.
